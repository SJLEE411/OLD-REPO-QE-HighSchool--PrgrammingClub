# OLD-REPO-QE-HighSchool--PrgrammingClub

### Introduction
Welcome to the Old Repo - Queen Elizabeth High School Programming Club collection. Here, I proudly present the web code and projects that I diligently crafted back in 2015, during my early days as a passionate high school graduate and a dedicated volunteer at the Queen Elizabeth High School Programming Club.

### Bruce Campbell Website
Notably, my work included projects commissioned by local realtor Bruce Campbell, a prominent figure in the Northern Edmonton area. 
These contributions further exemplified my commitment to creating meaningful solutions and collaborating with professionals in the field.
Commissioned to do only Landing page as a volunteer. This repo contains only the part that i specifically desinged with Bootstrap.

### QE High School APK

Although the APK itself isn't directly available for download from this repository, it remains accessible through various APK downloading websites. You can also explore it here:
